\begin{exercise}
    Let $\mathfrak p$ be a prime ideal in $A$.
    Show that $\mathfrak p[x]$ is a prime ideal in $A[x]$.
    If $\mathfrak m$ is a maximal ideal in $A$, is $\mathfrak m[x]$ a maximal ideal in $A[x]$?
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
    Let $\mathfrak p$ be a prime ideal in $A$, and consider the canonical surjective ring homomorphism $A[x] \to (A/\mathfrak p)[x]$.
    Its kernel is clearly $\mathfrak p[x]$, whence
    \begin{equation*}
        A[x] / \mathfrak p[x] \cong (A / \mathfrak p)[x].
    \end{equation*}
    Since $(A/\mathfrak p)[x]$ is an integral domain, it follows that $\mathfrak p[x]$ is prime.

    Moreover, if $\mathfrak m$ is a maximal ideal of $A$, then $\mathfrak m[x]$ is \emph{never} maximal: we have $A[x] / \mathfrak m[x] \cong (A/\mathfrak m)[x]$ by the argument above, so $\mathfrak m[x]$ is maximal if and only if $(A/\mathfrak m)[x]$ is a field.
    Since a polynomial ring is never a field, it follows that $\mathfrak m[x]$ is not maximal.
\end{solution}
