\begin{exercise}
Let \(\phi : A \to B\) be a ring homomorphism.
Let \(X = \Spec(A)\) and \(Y = \Spec(B)\).
If \(\mathfrak{q} \in Y\), then \(\phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})\) is a prime ideal of \(A\), i.e., a point of \(X\).
Hence \(\phi\) induces a mapping \(\phi^* : Y \to X\).
Show that
\begin{parts}
\part
If \(f \in A\) then \({\phi^*}^{-1}(X_f) = Y_{\phi(f)}\), and hence that \(\phi^*\) is continuous.
\part
If \(\mathfrak{a}\) is an ideal of \(A\), then \({\phi^*}^{-1}(V(\mathfrak{a})) = V(\mathfrak{a}^e)\).
\part
If \(\mathfrak{b}\) is an ideal of \(B\), then \(\bar{\phi^*(V(\mathfrak{b}))} = V(\mathfrak{b}^c)\).
\part
If \(\phi\) is surjective, then \(\phi^*\) is a homeomorphism of \(Y\) onto the closed subset \(V(\Ker(\phi))\) of \(X\).
(In particular, \(\Spec(A)\) and \(\Spec(A / \mathfrak{N})\) (where \(\mathfrak{N}\) is the nilradical of \(A\)) are naturally homeomorphic.)
\part
If \(\phi\) is injective, then \(\phi^*(Y)\) is dense in \(X\).
More precisely, \(\phi^*(Y)\) is dense in \(X\) \(\iff\) \(\Ker(\phi) \subseteq \mathfrak{N}\).
\part
Let \(\psi : B \to C\) be another ring homomorphism.
Then \((\psi \circ \phi)^* = \phi^* \circ \psi^*\).
\part
Let \(A\) be an integral domain with just one non-zero prime ideal \(\mathfrak{p}\), and let \(K\) be the field of fractions of \(A\).
Let \(B = (A / \mathfrak{p}) \times K\).
Define \(\phi : A \to B\) by \(\phi(x) = (\bar{x}, x)\), where \(\bar{x}\) is the image of \(x\) in \(A / \mathfrak{p}\).
Show that \(\phi^*\) is bijective but not a homeomorphism.

\begin{partsolution}{i}
If \(f \in A\), then \(\mathfrak{q} \in {\phi^*}^{-1}(X_f)\) if and only if \(\phi^*(\mathfrak{q}) = \phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q}) \in X_f\), which is the case if and only if \(f \notin \phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})\), which occurs if and only if \(\mathfrak{q} \in Y_{\phi(f)}\).
Thus, \({\phi^*}^{-1}(X_f) = Y_{\phi(f)}\).
Consequently, since preimages under \(\phi^*\) of basic open sets in \(X\) are open in \(Y\), it follows that \(\phi^*\) is continuous.
\end{partsolution}

\begin{partsolution}{ii}
Let \(\mathfrak{a}\) be an ideal of \(A\).
Suppose \(\mathfrak{q} \in {\phi^*}^{-1}(V(\mathfrak{a}))\), so that \(\phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q}) \in V(\mathfrak{a})\), or, in other words, \(\mathfrak{a} \subseteq \phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})\).
It follows that
\begin{equation*}
\varphi(\mathfrak{a}) \subseteq \phi(\phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})) \subseteq \mathfrak{q}.
\end{equation*}
Consequently, \(\mathfrak{a}^e \subseteq \mathfrak{q}\), so \(\mathfrak{q} \in V(\mathfrak{a}^e)\).
Thus, \({\phi^*}^{-1}(V(\mathfrak{a})) \subseteq V(\mathfrak{a}^e)\).

Conversely, suppose \(\mathfrak{q} \in V(\mathfrak{a}^e)\).
Then \(\mathfrak{a}^e \subseteq \mathfrak{q}\), so by Proposition~1.17, \(\mathfrak{a} \subseteq \varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{a}^e) \subseteq \varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q})\).
Thus, \(\varphi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q}) \in V(\mathfrak{a})\), so \(\mathfrak{q} \in {\phi^*}^{-1}(V(\mathfrak{a}))\).
It follows that \(V(\mathfrak{a}^e) \subseteq {\phi^*}^{-1}(V(\mathfrak{a}))\), so we conclude that \({\phi^*}^{-1}(V(\mathfrak{a})) = V(\mathfrak{a}^e)\).
\end{partsolution}

\begin{partsolution}{iii}
Let \(\mathfrak{b}\) be an ideal of \(B\).
Suppose \(\mathfrak{p} \in \phi^*(V(\mathfrak{b}))\), so that there exists some \(\mathfrak{q} \in V(\mathfrak{b})\) such that \(\phi^{-1}(\mathfrak{q}) = \mathfrak{p}\).
Then \(\mathfrak{b} \subseteq \mathfrak{q}\), so \(\mathfrak{b}^c \subseteq \mathfrak{p}\), whence \(\mathfrak{p} \in V(\mathfrak{b}^c)\).
Therefore, \(\phi^*(V(\mathfrak{b})) \subseteq V(\mathfrak{b}^c)\), so, since \(V(\mathfrak{b}^c)\) is closed, \(\bar{\phi^*(V(\mathfrak{b}))} \subseteq V(\mathfrak{b}^c)\).

Conversely, suppose \(\mathfrak{p} \in V(\mathfrak{b}^c)\), and let \(X_f\), for some \(f \in A\), be a basic open neighborhood of \(\mathfrak{p}\).
We claim that \(\phi^*(V(\mathfrak{b})) \cap X_f\) is nonempty, whence it will follow that \(\mathfrak{p} \in \bar{\phi^*(V(\mathfrak{b}))}\).

Since \(r(\mathfrak{b}^c) = r(\mathfrak{b})^c\) by Exercise~1.18 in the text, \expartref{1}{15}{i} implies that \(V(\mathfrak{b}^c) = V(r(\mathfrak{b})^c)\).
In particular, \(\mathfrak{p} \in V(r(\mathfrak{b})^c)\), so \(r(\mathfrak{b})^c \subseteq \mathfrak{p}\).
Since \(\mathfrak{p} \in X_f\) (i.e., \(f \notin \mathfrak{p}\)) and \(r(\mathfrak{b})^c \subseteq \mathfrak{p}\), it follows that \(f \notin r(\mathfrak{b})^c\), so \(\phi(f) \notin r(\mathfrak{b})\).
Consequently, by Proposition~1.14 there exists a \(\mathfrak{q} \in V(\mathfrak{b})\) such that \(\phi(f) \notin \mathfrak{q}\).
Thus, \(f \notin \phi^*(\mathfrak{q})\), so \(\phi^*(\mathfrak{q}) \in \phi^*(V(\mathfrak{b})) \cap X_f\).
Therefore, \(\phi^*(V(\mathfrak{b})) \cap X_f\) is nonempty, so \(\mathfrak{p} \in \bar{\phi^*(V(\mathfrak{b}))}\), and hence \(V(\mathfrak{b}^c) \subseteq \bar{\phi^*(V(\mathfrak{b}))}\).
We conclude that \(\bar{\phi^*(V(\mathfrak{b}))} = V(\mathfrak{b}^c)\).
