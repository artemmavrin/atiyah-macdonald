\begin{exercise}
Let \(x\) be a nilpotent element of a ring \(A\).
Show that \(1 + x\) is a unit of \(A\).
Deduce that the sum of a nilpotent element and a unit is a unit.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
Let \(y = -x\).
Then \(y\) is also nilpotent, so choose a positive integer \(n\) such that \(y^n = 0\).
We have
\begin{align*}
(1 - y) (1 + y + y^2 + \cdots + y^{n-1})
= 1 - y^n
= 1
\end{align*}
which shows that \(1 + x = 1 - y\) is a unit.

Next, let \(x\in A\) be nilpotent and \(u\in A\) a unit.
Then \(u^{-1} x\) is nilpotent, so \(1 + u^{-1}x\) is a unit by the first part.
Therefore
\begin{equation*}
u + x = u(1 + u^{-1} x).
\end{equation*}
Since it is a product of units, \(u + x\) is a unit.
\end{solution}

\begin{solution}[Alternative Solution]
Since \(x\) belongs to the Jacobson radical of \(A\) by Proposition~1.8, Proposition~1.9 implies that \(1 - x y\) is a unit for every \(y \in A\).
In particular, \(1 + x\) is a unit (take \(y = -1\)).
The rest follows as before.
