\section{Construction of an algebraic closure of a field (E. Artin)}

\begin{exercise}
Let \(K\) be a field and let \(\Sigma\) be the set of all irreducible monic polynomials \(f\) in one indeterminate with coefficients in \(K\).
Let \(A\) be the polynomial ring over \(K\) generated by indeterminates \(x_f\), one for each \(f \in \Sigma\).
Let \(\mathfrak a\) be the ideal of \(A\) generated by the polynomials  \(f(x_f)\) for all \(f\in \Sigma\).
Show that \(\mathfrak a \neq (1)\).

Let \(\mathfrak m\) be a maximal ideal of \(A\) containing \(\mathfrak a\), and let \(K_1 = A/\mathfrak m\).
Then \(K_1\) is an extension field of \(K\) in which each \(f \in \Sigma\) has a root.
Repeat the construction with \(K_1\) in place of \(K\), obtaining a field \(K_2\), and so on.
Let \(L = \bigcup_{n=1}^\infty K_n\).
Then \(L\) is a field in which each \(f \in \Sigma\) splits completely into linear factors.
Let \(\bar K\) be the set of all elements of \(L\) which are algebraic over \(K\).
Then \(\bar K\) is an algebraic closure of \(K\).
