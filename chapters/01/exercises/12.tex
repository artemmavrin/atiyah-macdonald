\begin{exercise}
A local ring contains no idempotent \(\neq 0, 1\).
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
Let \(A\) be a local ring with maximal ideal \(\mathfrak{m}\), and let \(x \in A\) be idempotent.
If \(x\) is a unit, then dividing the equation \(x^2 = x\) by \(x\) yields \(x = 1\).
Otherwise, \(x \in \mathfrak{m}\).
In that case, \(1 - x\) is a unit by Proposition~1.9, and
\begin{equation*}
x (1 - x) = x - x^2 = 0
\end{equation*}
since \(x^2 = x\), so \(x = 0\).
\end{solution}
