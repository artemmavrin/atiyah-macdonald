\begin{exercise}
Let \(A = \prod_{i=1}^n A_i\) be the direct product of rings \(A_i\).
Show that \(\Spec(A)\) is the disjoint union of open (and closed) subspaces \(X_i\), where \(X_i\) is canonically homeomorphic with \(\Spec(A_i)\).

Conversely, let \(A\) be any ring.
Show that the following statements are equivalent:
\begin{parts}
\part
\(X = \Spec(A)\) is disconnected.
\part
\(A \cong A_1 \times A_2\) where neither of the rings \(A_1, A_2\) is the zero ring.
\part
\(A\) contains an idempotent \(\neq 0, 1\).
\end{parts}

In particular, the spectrum of a local ring is always connected (\exref{1}{12}).
