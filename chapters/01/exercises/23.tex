\begin{exercise}
Let \(A\) be a Boolean ring (\exref{1}{11}), and let \(X = \Spec(A)\).
\begin{parts}
\part
For each \(f \in A\), the set \(X_f\) (\exref{1}{17}) is both open and closed in \(X\).
\part
Let \(f_1,\ldots,f_n \in A\).
Show that \(X_{f_1} \cup \cdots \cup X_{f_n} = X_f\) for some \(f \in A\).
\part
The sets \(X_f\) are the only subsets of \(X\) which are both open and closed.
[Let \(Y \subseteq X\) be both open and closed.
Since \(Y\) is open, it is a union of basic open sets \(X_f\).
Since \(Y\) is closed and \(X\) is quasi-compact (\exref{1}{17}), \(Y\) is quasi-compact.
Hence \(Y\) is a finite union of basic open sets; now use \partref{1}{23}{ii} above.]
\part
\(X\) is a compact Hausdorff space.
