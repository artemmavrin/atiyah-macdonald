\begin{exercise}
Let \(A\) be a ring and let \(A[[x]]\) be the ring of formal power series \(f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n\) with coefficients in \(A\).
Show that
\begin{parts}
\part
\(f\) is a unit in \(A[[x]]\) \(\iff\) \(a_0\) is a unit in \(A\).
\part
If \(f\) is nilpotent, then \(a_n\) is nilpotent for all \(n\geq 0\).
Is the converse true?
(See Chapter~7, Exercise~2.)
\part
\(f\) belongs to the Jacobson radical of \(A[[x]]\) \(\iff\) \(a_0\) belongs to the Jacobson radical of \(A\).
\part
The contraction of a maximal ideal \(\mathfrak m\) of \(A[[x]]\) is a maximal ideal of \(A\), and \(\mathfrak m\) is generated by \(\mathfrak m^c\) and \(x\).
\part
Every prime ideal of \(A\) is the contraction of a prime ideal of \(A[[x]]\).
\end{parts}
