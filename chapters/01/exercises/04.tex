\begin{exercise}
In the ring \(A[x]\), the Jacobson radical is equal to the nilradical.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
Let \(\mathfrak{N}\) and \(\mathfrak{R}\) be the nilradical and Jacobson radical of \(A[x]\), respectively.
We necessarily have \(\mathfrak{N} \subseteq \mathfrak{R}\) (by Proposition~1.8), so it suffices to prove that \(\mathfrak{R} \subseteq \mathfrak{N}\).
Let \(f \in \mathfrak R\) be given.
By Proposition 1.9, \(1 + x f\) is a unit in \(A[x]\), so by \expartref{1}{2}{i}, the coefficients of the non-constant terms of \(1 + x f\) are nilpotent.
Thus, the coefficients of \(x f\), and hence of \(f\) itself, are nilpotent, and so \(f\) itself is nilpotent by \expartref{1}{2}{ii}, whence \(\mathfrak R \subseteq \mathfrak N\).
\end{solution}
