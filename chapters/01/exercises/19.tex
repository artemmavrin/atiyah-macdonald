\begin{exercise}
A topological space \(X\) is said to be irreducible if \(X \neq \emptyset\) and if every pair of non-empty open sets in \(X\) intersect, or equivalently if every non-empty open set is dense in \(X\).
Show that \(\Spec(A)\) is irreducible if and only if the nilradical of \(A\) is a prime ideal.
