\begin{exercise}

\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
We draw inspiration from \cite[Chapter~II]{EisenbudHarrisGeometryOfSchemes},  \cite[Chapter~II,~\S1]{MumfordRedBook}, and \cite[Chapter~3]{VakilNotes}.

\begin{enumerate}
\item
The ring \(\mathbf{Z}\) is a principal ideal domain whose prime/irreducible elements are, up to a multiple of \(-1\), exactly the positive prime integers.
Consequently, the prime ideals of \(\mathbf{Z}\) are the maximal ideals \((p)\) for positive prime numbers \(p\), and the zero ideal \((0)\).

\autoref{fig:Spec(Z)} is a picture of \(\Spec(\mathbf{Z})\).

\begin{figure}

\input{images/Spec(Z)}
\caption{%
\(\Spec(\mathbf{Z})\) consists of a closed point \((p)\) for each positive prime number \(p\), as well as a generic point corresponding to the minimal prime ideal \((0)\).%
}
\label{fig:Spec(Z)}
\end{figure}

\item
The only prime ideal of the field \(\mathbf{R}\) is the zero ideal.
Thus, \(\Spec(\mathbf{R})\) consists of a single point: \(\bullet\).
In fact, for any ring \(A\), the space \(\Spec(A)\) consists of a single point if and only if \(A\) is a field.
\item
The polynomial ring \(\mathbf{C}[x]\) is a principal ideal domain, so its non-zero prime ideals are maximal and generated by monic, irreducible polynomials.
Since \(\mathbf{C}\) is algebraically closed, these polynomials are of the form \(x - a\) for \(a \in \mathbf{C}\).
Also, the zero ideal \((0)\) is prime and is a generic point of \(\Spec(\mathbf{C}[x])\).

If we identify the closed points of \(\Spec(\mathbf{C}[x])\) (i.e., maximal ideals of \(\mathbf{C}[x]\)) with complex numbers via the correspondence \((x - a) \leftrightarrow a\), then the subspace topology on the set of closed points of \(\Spec(\mathbf{C}[x])\) coincides with the classical Zariski topology on the affine line \(\mathbf{A}_{\mathbf{C}}^1 = \mathbf{C}\), in which the closed sets are sets on which a polynomial in one variable with complex coefficients vanishes (which, in the one-dimensional case, happens to be the cofinite topology).

\autoref{fig:Spec(C[x])} is a picture of \(\Spec(\mathbf{C}[x])\).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\input{images/Spec(C[x])}
\caption{%
\(\Spec(\mathbf{C[x]})\) is the one-dimensional complex affine line consisting of a closed point \((x - a)\) for each \(a \in \mathbf{C}\), as well as a generic point corresponding to the minimal prime ideal \((0)\).%
}
\label{fig:Spec(C[x])}
\end{figure}

\item
The non-zero prime ideals of \(\mathbf R[x]\) correspond to monic irreducible polynomials over \(\mathbf R\).
These are either of the form \(x - a\) with \(a \in \mathbf R\), or of the form \(x^2 + bx + c\), with \(b^2 - 4c < 0\).
Each polynomial of the latter type corresponds to two conjugate complex numbers with non-zero imaginary part, the roots of the polynomial.
Thus \(\Spec(\mathbf R[x])\) can be seen as the complex plane folded along the real axis (or with conjugate points identified), together with an extra generic point, the zero ideal.

\item
The non-zero prime ideals of \(\mathbf{Z}[x]\) are of two forms.
First, there are the principle prime ideals \((f)\), where either \(f \in \mathbf{Z}\) is a positive prime number or \(f \in \mathbf{Z}[x]\) is a \(\mathbf{Q}\)-irreducible polynomial written with coefficients reduced to have g.c.d. \(= 1\).
Second, there are the maximal ideals, which are of the form \((p, f)\), where \(p\) is a positive prime integer and \(f \in \mathbf{Z}[x]\) is a monic polynomial which is irreducible modulo \(p\).

\autoref{fig:Spec(Z[x])} is a picture of \(\Spec(\mathbf{Z}[x])\) taken from \cite[Chapter~2, \S1, Example~H]{MumfordRedBook}.
