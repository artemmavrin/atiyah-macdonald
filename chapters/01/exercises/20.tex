\begin{exercise}
Let \(X\) be a topological space.
\begin{parts}
\part
If \(Y\) is an irreducible (\exref{1}{19}) subspace of \(X\), then the closure \(\overline Y\) of \(Y\) in \(X\) is irreducible.
\part
Every irreducible subspace of \(X\) is contained in a maximal irreducible subspace.
\part
The maximal irreducible subspaces of \(X\) are closed and cover \(X\).
They are called the \emph{irreducible components} of \(X\).
What are the irreducible components of a Hausdorff space?
\part
If \(A\) is a ring and \(X = \Spec(A)\), then the irreducible components of \(X\) are the closed sets \(V(\mathfrak p)\), where \(\mathfrak p\) is a minimal prime ideal of \(A\) (\exref{1}{8}).
\end{parts}
\end{exercise}

\begin{partsolution}{i}
Let \(Y\) be an irreducible subspace of \(X\), and let \(U, V\) be nonempty open subsets of \(\bar{Y}\).
Also, choose open subsets \(U^\prime, V^\prime\) of \(X\) such that \(U = \bar{Y} \cap U^\prime\) and \(V = \bar{Y} \cap V^\prime\).
In particular, \(\bar{Y} \cap U^\prime\) is nonempty, so \(Y \cap U^\prime\) is nonempty.
Similarly, \(Y \cap V^\prime\) is nonempty.
Since \(Y \cap U^\prime\) and \(Y \cap V^\prime\) are nonempty open subsets of the irreducible space \(Y\), their intersection is nonempty.
It follows that \(U \cap V\) is nonempty, so \(\bar{Y}\) is irreducible.
