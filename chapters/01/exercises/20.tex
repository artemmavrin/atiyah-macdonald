\begin{exercise}
Let \(X\) be a topological space.
\begin{parts}
\part
If \(Y\) is an irreducible (Exercise \ref{ex:1.19}) subspace of \(X\), then the closure \(\overline Y\) of \(Y\) in \(X\) is irreducible.
\part
Every irreducible subspace of \(X\) is contained in a maximal irreducible subspace.
\part
The maximal irreducible subspaces of \(X\) are closed and cover \(X\).
They are called the \emph{irreducible components} of \(X\).
What are the irreducible components of a Hausdorff space?
\part
If \(A\) is a ring and \(X = \Spec(A)\), then the irreducible components of \(X\) are the closed sets \(V(\mathfrak p)\), where \(\mathfrak p\) is a minimal prime ideal of \(A\) (Exercise \ref{ex:1.8}).
