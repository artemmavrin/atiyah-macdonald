\begin{exercise}
Let \(A\) be a Noetherian ring and let \(f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n \in A[[x]]\).
Prove that \(f\) is nilpotent if and only if each \(a_n\) is nilpotent.
\end{exercise}

\begin{solution}
(\(\Rightarrow\)) This direction follows from \expartref{1}{5}{ii}, which does not use the Noetherian assumption.

(\(\Leftarrow\))
Suppose each \(a_n\) is nilpotent.
Let \(\mathfrak{a}\) be the ideal generated by the \(a_n\)'s, which is contained in the nilradical of \(A\).
Since \(A\) is Noetherian, there exist (necessarily nilpotent) \(b_1, \ldots, b_N \in A\) such that \(\mathfrak{a} = (b_1, \ldots, b_N)\).
For each \(n\), choose \(r_{n, 1}, \ldots, r_{n, N} \in A\) such that
\begin{equation*}
a_n = r_{n, 1} b_1 + \cdots + r_{n, N} b_N.
\end{equation*}
Then we have
\begin{equation*}
f = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n x^n
= \sum_{n=0}^\infty \sum_{k=1}^N r_{n, k} b_k x^n
= \sum_{k=1}^N b_k \left(\sum_{n=1}^\infty r_{n, k} x^n\right).
\end{equation*}
Since the nilradical of \(A[[x]]\) is an ideal, \(f\) is nilpotent.
